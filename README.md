## Usage

To use this weather dashboard, you can type in any city by name into the input bar. After clicking search the current weather with weather features, as well as the weather for the next 5 days will appear. If you refresh the page a history button with the previous city will remain. You can also go back to see the weather for that city by clicking on its button.
